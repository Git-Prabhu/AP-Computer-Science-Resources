<html><title> Read_me for EasyEvents files</title>
<body>
This <b>EasyEvents</b> material is suitable as a supplement to any CS 1 Java textbook, starting only a few weeks into the semester.  Students learn to do GUI programming using event-handlers such as buttons and textfields.  The special library of <b>E-objects </b> furnished here makes their use as simple and easy as possible.  The instructional material gives a quick but adequate explanation of all but the most basic Java language features, which makes it independent of the particular CS 1 textbook used.  It should even be adequate by itself for most students who have completed a full CS 1 course in <u>another</u> programming language.

The downloadable <a href="EasyEvents.zip"> zipped folder</a> fits easily onto a floppy disk, less than 900K. If all you want is the .html files and the E-object library .java and .class files, <a href="EEessentials.zip">click here </a>for the zipped folder of only 29 files.
<p>
All of the material is accessible over the internet from my server. Individual users should feel free to study it on-line.  For extended study, <b>it would save me bandwidth if you downloaded the zipped folder and unzipped it on your own machine.</b> As long as you put any programs that use these E-objects in the same folder as the E-object .class files, you should have no trouble compiling your programs. 
<p>
If you are a teacher of CS 1, then after a few weeks or a few months of having your students use these E-object classes, you will find it highly manageable to switch your students to the use of Sun's standard javax.swing library.  I believe this is the best way for students to come to a thorough understanding of the javax.swing library.  They can easily remember what is the nonstandard stuff, since it all starts with E (EField, EButton, etc.).
