  <h1 align="center">The Four Levels of Access Protection</h1>
<p>
Any two different Java objects have one of four relations to each
other. The four relations are:
</p>



<ul>
<li>The objects are in the same class.</li>

<li>One object is a subclass of the other object's class.</li>

<li>The objects are in the same package.</li>

<li>None of the above. (Both objects are members of the general
public.)</li>
</ul>

<p>
These relationships are not mutually exclusive. One object can be a
subclass of another object in the same package, for example.
</p>

<p>You can define which of your class's members, that is its fields
and its methods, are accessible to other objects in each of these
four groups, relative to the current class.</p>

<p>If you want any object at all to be able to call a method or
change a field, declare it <code>public</code>.</p>

<p>If you want only objects in the same class to be able to get or
set the value of a field or invoke a method, declare it <code>
private</code>.</p>

<p>If you want access restricted to subclasses and members of the
same package, declare it <code>protected</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, to restrict access only to objects in the same package,
use no access declaration at all. This is called "package" or
"default" access, but it has no keyword. The <code>default</code>
keyword means something else entirely.</p>

<p>Can anyone remember what?</p>

<p>By default, all classes you write are in the same package.
However, they are in different packages from the Java classes like
<code>System</code> or <code>Applet</code>.</p>

<p>The public fields and methods of an object can be accessed from
anywhere the object itself can be seen. Anyone can touch an
object's public members. They should be kept to a minimum. Public
fields should relate very closely to the core functionality of the
class. They should not show intimate details of the inner workings
of the class. Except in very simple instances fields should
probably not be public.</p>

<p>The private fields and methods of an object can only be accessed
by the object itself and by other objects of the same class
(siblings). An object may touch its sibling's private parts. A
sibling is an object in the same class but which is not the same
object.</p>
