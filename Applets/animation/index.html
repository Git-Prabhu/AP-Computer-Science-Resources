<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG>Summary</STRONG><BR>Many Java applets perform animation, 
  whether it's the classic, cartoon-style animation of Duke waving, 
  program-generated lines such as flowing sine waves, or simply moving static

  (yet) for creating Java animations. So it's up to the applet programmer to do

<H2>Basic Animation Techniques</H2></A>Many forms of animation are possible in 
Java. What all of them have in common is that they create some kind of motion on 
the screen by drawing successive frames at a relatively high speed (usually 
about 10-20 times per second). 
<P>We will start by creating a simple template applet for doing animations and 
slowly elaborate it until we arrive at a fairly complete applet. 
<P><A name=thread></A><STRONG><FONT size=+1>Using a Thread</FONT></STRONG><BR>To 
update the screen multiple times per second, you need to create a new Java 
thread that contains an animation loop. The animation loop is responsible for 
keeping track of the current frame and for requesting periodic screen updates. 
To implement a thread, you must either create a subclass of <A 
href="http://java.sun.com/JDK-1.0/api/java.lang.Thread.html">Thread</A> or 
adhere to the <A 
href="http://java.sun.com/JDK-1.0/api/java.lang.Runnable.html">Runnable</A> 
interface. 
<P>A common mistake is to put the animation loop in the <CODE><B><A 
href="http://java.sun.com/JDK-1.0/api/java.awt.Component.html#paint">paint() 
</A></B></CODE>method of an applet. Doing so will have strange side effects 
because it holds up the main AWT thread, which is in charge of all drawing and 
event handling. 
<P>As an example I have written a small template applet, called Example1Applet, 
that illustrates the general outline of an animation applet. Example1Applet 
shows how to create a thread and call the <CODE><B><A 
href="http://java.sun.com/JDK-1.0/api/java.awt.Component.html#repaint">repaint()</A></B></CODE> 
method at fixed intervals. The number of frames per second is specified by 
passing in an applet parameter. Here is an example of what you would put in your 
HTML document: <PRE>    &lt;applet code=Example1Applet.class width=200 height=200&gt;
    &lt;param name=fps value=20&gt;
    &lt;/applet&gt;
</PRE><B><A 
href="http://www.javaworld.com/jw-03-1996/animation/Example1Applet.html">Here is 
Example1Applet.</A></B> 
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG><BR>This applet doesn't actually draw anything on the 
screen yet. Drawing to the screen is explained later. Note also that the applet 
destroys its animation thread whenever the user leaves the page (which results 
in the applet's <CODE><B>stop()</B></CODE> method being called). This ensures 
that the applet won't waste CPU time while its page isn't visible. 
<P><A name=frameRate></A><STRONG><FONT size=+1>Keeping a Constant Frame 
Rate</FONT></STRONG><BR>In the example above, the applet simply sleeps for a 
fixed amount of time between frames. This has the drawback that you sometimes 
wait too long. To get 10 frames per second you should not wait 100 milliseconds 
between frames, because you lose some time just running the thread. 
<P>The following applet, Example2Applet, shows how to keep better time. It 
simply computes the correct delay between frames by keeping track of the 
starting time. It computes the estimated required delay between frames based on 
the current time. 
<P><B><A 
href="http://www.javaworld.com/jw-03-1996/animation/Example2Applet.html">Here is 
Example2Applet.</A></B> 
<P><A name=painting></A><STRONG><FONT size=+1>Painting Each 
Frame</FONT></STRONG><BR>What remains is to paint each frame. In the previous 
examples, we call <CODE><B>repaint()</B></CODE> for each frame, which causes the 
applet's <CODE><B><A 
href="http://java.sun.com/JDK-1.0/api/java.awt.Component.html#paint">paint() 
</A></B></CODE>method to be called. The Example3Applet has a 
<CODE><B>paint()</B></CODE> method that draws the number of the current frame to 
the screen. 
<P><B><A 
href="http://www.javaworld.com/jw-03-1996/animation/Example3Applet.html">Here is 
Example3Applet in action, followed by a code listing.</A></B> 
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG><BR>If you specify the frame rate to be very high (say 
100 frames per second), the <CODE><B>run()</B></CODE> method will call 
<CODE><B>repaint()</B></CODE> 100 times per second. However, this will not 
always result in 100 calls to <CODE><B>paint()</B></CODE> per second because 
when you issue repaint request too quickly they will be collapsed into a single 
screen update. This is why we keep track of the current frame number in the 
<CODE><B>run()</B></CODE> method rather then in the <CODE><B>paint()</B></CODE> 
method. 
<P><A name=graphics></A><STRONG><FONT size=+1>Generating 
Graphics</FONT></STRONG><BR>Now let's animate something that is a little harder 
to draw. The Example4Applet draws a combination of sine waves. For each x 
coordinate, it draws a short vertical line. All these lines together form a 
simple graph that changes for each frame. Unfortunately, you will find that this 
approach causes a lot of flashing. We'll explain the cause of the flashing and 
some remedies in the next section. 
<P><B><A 
href="http://www.javaworld.com/jw-03-1996/animation/Example4Applet.html">Here is 
Example4Applet in action, followed by a code listing.</A></B> 
<P><A name=flashing></A>
<H2>Avoiding Excessive Flashing</H2>The flashing you see in Example4Applet has 
two causes: painting each frame takes too long (due to the amount of computation 
that is required during the repaint) and the entire background is cleared before 
<CODE><B>paint()</B></CODE> is called. While the computation of the next frame 
is going on, the user is seeing the background of the animation. 
<P>This short time between the clearing of the background and the painting of 
the sine wave is seen as a flash. On some platforms like the PC, the flashing is 
more obvious then it is on X Windows. The reason is that the X Windows graphics 
are buffered, which makes the flash a little shorter. 
<P>You can reduce flashing greatly using two simple tricks: implementing the 
<CODE><B>update()</B></CODE> method and using double buffering (sometimes known 
as <EM>using a backbuffer</EM>). 
<P><A name=update></A><STRONG><FONT size=+1>Overriding the update() 
Method</FONT></STRONG><BR>When the AWT receives a repaint request for an applet, 
it calls the applet's <CODE><B>update()</B></CODE> method. By default, the 
<CODE><B>update()</B></CODE> method clears the applet's background and then 
calls the <CODE><B>paint()</B></CODE> method. By overriding the 
<CODE><B>update()</B></CODE> method to include the drawing code that used to be 
in the <CODE><B>paint()</B></CODE> method, we avoid having the applet's entire 
area cleared with every repaint. 
<P>Now that the background is no longer cleared automatically, we need to do it 
ourselves in the <CODE><B>update()</B></CODE> method. We can now erase each 
vertical line of the graph individually before drawing the new line, eliminating 
the flashing completely. This effect is shown in Example5Applet. 
<P><B><A 
href="http://www.javaworld.com/jw-03-1996/animation/Example5Applet.html">Here is 
Example5Applet in action, followed by a code listing.</A></B> 
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG><BR>Whenever you override the 
<CODE><B>update()</B></CODE> method, you still need to implement 
<CODE><B>paint()</B></CODE>. This is because the <CODE><B>paint()</B></CODE> 
method is called directly by the AWT drawing system whenever "damage" occurs to 
the applet's drawing area -- for example, when a window obscuring part of the 
applet's drawing area is removed from the screen. Your 
<CODE><B>paint()</B></CODE> implementation can simply call 
<CODE><B>update()</B></CODE>. 
<P><A name=doubleBuffer></A><STRONG><FONT size=+1>Double 
Buffering</FONT></STRONG><BR>Another way of reducing the flashing between frames 
is to use double buffering. This technique is used in many animation applets. 
<P>The general principle is that you create an offscreen image, you draw a frame 
into the image, and then you slap the entire image onto the screen with one call 
to <CODE><B>drawImage()</B></CODE>. The advantage is that most of the drawing is 
done offscreen. The final painting of the offscreen image onto the screen is 
usually much more efficient than painting the frame directly to the screen. 
<P>The sine wave applet with double buffering is shown in Example6Applet. You 
will see that the animation is pretty smooth and you don't need any special 
tricks when drawing the frame. The only disadvantage is that you have to 
allocate an offscreen image that is as large as the drawing area. If the drawing 
area is very large, this may demand quite a lot of memory. 
<P><B><A 
href="http://www.javaworld.com/jw-03-1996/animation/Example6Applet.html">Here is 
Example6Applet in action, followed by a code listing.</A></B> 
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG><BR>When you use double buffering, you need to override 
the <CODE><B>update()</B></CODE> method, since you don't want the applet's 
background to be cleared before you paint the frame. (You clear the background 
yourself by drawing to the offscreen image.) 
<P><A name=images></A>
<H2>Using Images</H2>Now we'll rewrite the <CODE><B>paintFrame()</B></CODE> 
method with a method that animates some images. This adds some minor 
complications to the problem. Images are rather large and they are loaded 
incrementally. It can take a long time for images to be fully drawn, especially 
when you are loading them over a slow connection. This is the reason why the 
<CODE><B>drawImage()</B></CODE> method takes a fourth argument, an ImageObserver 
object. The image observer is an object that is notified when more of the image 
data has arrived. To get the images we use the <CODE><B>getImage()</B></CODE> 
method. 
<P><A name=movingImage></A><STRONG><FONT size=+1>Moving an Image Across the 
Screen</FONT></STRONG><BR>This first image-animating applet, Example7Applet, 
uses the following two images: 
<P>world.gif: <IMG height=156 src="world.gif" width=166> car.gif: <IMG height=52 
src="car.gif" width=64> 
<P>The world image is used as the background, and the car image is drawn on top 
of it twice, creating an animation of two cars racing across the world.

<P><A name=imageSequence></A><STRONG><FONT size=+1>Displaying a Sequence of 
Images</FONT></STRONG><BR>Example8Applet shows how to create an animation using 
separate images for each frame. Here are the 10 frames that are being used:

<P>We are still using double buffering to eliminate flashing. The reason is that 
each image that we are rendering is partially transparent, and we therefore need 
to erase each frame before drawing the next. This would cause flashing without 
double buffering. 
<P><B><A 
href="http://www.javaworld.com/jw-03-1996/animation/Example8Applet.html">Here is 
Example8Applet in action, followed by a code listing.</A></B> 
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG><BR>When displaying sequences of images, you have to be 
careful to align the images correctly. The easiest way is to make sure that the 
images are all the same size and can be drawn at the same position. If that 
isn't the case, your applet will have to draw each frame at a different offset. 
<P><A name=MediaTracker></A><STRONG><FONT size=+1>Using MediaTracker to Avoid 
Incremental Display</FONT></STRONG><BR>When a Java program loads an image, it 
can display the image before the image is completely loaded. The user sees the 
image being rendered first incompletely, and then incrementally more and more 
completely as the image is loaded. This incremental display gives the user 
feedback (improving perceived performance) and lets the program easily perform 
other tasks while the image is loading. 
<P>Where animation is concerned, incremental image display can be useful for 
background images, but it can be very distracting when used for the animated 
images. It is therefore sometimes desirable to wait until the entire animation 
is loaded before displaying it. 
<P>You can use <A href="http://java.sun.com/people/flar/">Jim Graham's</A> <A 
href="http://java.sun.com/JDK-1.0/api/java.awt.MediaTracker.html">MediaTracker</A> 
class to track the downloading of images, delaying the animation display until 
the entire set of images is fully downloaded. <A

shows how to use the MediaTracker class to download images for the waving Duke 
animation.

Example9Applet in action, followed by a code listing.</A></B> 
<P><A name=sound></A>
<H2>Adding Sound</H2>It's easy to add sound to an animation. You can use the 
<CODE><B>getAudioClip()</B></CODE> method to get an AudioClip object. Later, you 
can play the clip either as a continuous loop or as a single sound. 
Example10Applet shows how to play a continuous background sound as well as a 
repetitive sound during the animation. 
<P><B><A 
href="http://www.javaworld.com/jw-03-1996/animation/Example10Applet.html">Here 
is Example10Applet in action, followed by a code listing.</A></B> 
<P><STRONG>Note:</STRONG><BR>When playing a continuous sound you must remember 
to stop it when the user leaves the page (i.e., do it in your applet's 
<CODE><B>stop()</B></CODE> method). 
<P><STRONG>Another Note:</STRONG><BR>Continuous audio can be very annoying. It 
is a good idea to provide the user with a way to turn off the audio without 
leaving the page. You can provide a button, or simply turn off the audio when 
the user clicks in the applet. 
<P><A name=imageLoading></A>
<H2>Tips for Loading Images Faster</H2>An animation that uses many images will 
take a long time to download. This is mainly due to the fact that a new HTTP 
connection is made for every image file, and making a connection can take 
several seconds even when there is plenty of bandwidth. 
<P>In this section, we'll tell you about two image formats your applet can use 
to make downloading images faster. 
<P><A name=imageStrip></A><STRONG><FONT size=+1>Using an Image 
Strip</FONT></STRONG><BR>
<P>You can improve downloading performance by using a single image containing 
several frames of animation. You can render a single frame out of the image by 
using the <CODE><B>clipRect()</B></CODE> operator. Below is an example of an 
image strip that is used in the UnderConstruction applet. 
<P>jack.gif: <IMG height=90 src="index_files/jack.gif" width=328> 
<P>The applet creates a drilling effect by not erasing the previous frames. The 
background is cleared only every so often. 
<P><B><A 
href="http://www.javaworld.com/jw-03-1996/animation/UnderConstruction.html">Here 
is UnderConstruction in action, with a link to its source code.</A></B> 
<P><A name=flic></A><STRONG><FONT size=+1>Inter-Frame Compression Using 
Flic</FONT></STRONG><BR>If you really want to improve the downloading 
performance of an animation consisting of multiple frames, then you have to use 
some form of inter-frame compression. I have found two sites that support the 
Flic compression format.

<H2>Animation Tools</H2>At this moment (January 1996), few tools are available 
to help you create Java-powered animations. The best tool that I could find is 
<A href="http://www.dnx.com/">DimensionX</A>'s <A 
href="http://www.dnx.com/scott/jam/">The Easy Animator (TEA)</A> (previously 
known as JAM). It lets you create animations interactively. We'd like to 
encourage developers to write more tools for the creating of animations in Java. 

<P>If you have a few ready-made images to display, you can use the <A 
href="http://java.sun.com/applets/applets/Animator/">Animator applet.</A> 
Animator has many parameters that let you specify continuous sounds, 
frame-specific sounds, individual frame timing and positions, a startup image, 
frame ordering, and so on. 
<P>You should also check out the <A 
href="http://www.gamelan.com/Gamelan.animation.html">Gamelan Animation</A> page 
to find many applets that use animation. 
<P><A name=thatsallfolks></A>
<H2>Conclusion</H2>I hope this article will help applet developers write more 
and better animation applets. I also hope that better tools will become 
available soon. <IMG alt=[] src="index_files/dingbat.gif">
