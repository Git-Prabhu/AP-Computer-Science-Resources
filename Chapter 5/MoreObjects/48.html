  <h1 align="center">Naming Packages</h1>
<p>
As you saw earlier name space conflicts arise if two pieces of code
declare the same name. Java keeps track of what belongs to each
package internally. Thus if Sun decides to put a <code>
Website</code> class in java.lang in Java 2.0, it won't conflict
with a <code>Website</code> class defined in an <code>http</code>
package. Since they're in different packages Java can tell them
apart. Just as you tell John Smith apart from John Jones by their
last names, so too does Java tell two Website classes apart by
their package names.
</p>

<p>However this scheme breaks down if two different classes share
the same package name as well as class name. In a world in which
many different packages can be downloaded from many different
sites, all landing in the user's CLASSPATH, it's not unthinkable
that two different people might write packages called <code>
http</code> with a class called <code>Website</code>.</p>

<p>To ensure that package names don't conflict with each other, Sun
asks that you prefix all your packages with a reversed domain name.
Thus if your domain name is poly.edu, your package names should
begin with <code>edu.poly</code>. Within that domain you are
responsible for making sure that no one else writes a package that
conflicts with yours.</p>

<p>If you don't have a personal domain name, only an account with
an Internet service provider, then add your username to this as
well. For instance under this scheme the package prefix for
foo@utopia.poly.edu would be <code>edu.poly.utopia.foo</code>.</p>

<p>This is primarily of interest to applet writers, not applet
users. If you're surfing the net and you load one applet from MIT
that has a <code>http.Website</code> class and another from
Polytechnic that has a different <code>http.Website</code> class,
Java can still tell them apart because before it runs any package
it downloads off the net it prefixes everything with the site from
which it got it. In other words it sees <code>
edu.poly.www.http.Website</code> and <code>
edu.mit.www.http.Website</code>. It's only when you download a
package manually and install it in one directory in your CLASSPATH
and install another package elsewhere in your CLASSPATH that real
name conflicts can arise if packages aren't carefully prefixed with
a domain or email address.</p>
