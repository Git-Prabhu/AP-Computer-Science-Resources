  <h1 align="center">Interfaces</h1>
<p>
Interfaces are the next level of abstraction. An interface is like
a class with nothing but <code>abstract</code> methods and <code>
final</code>, <code>static</code> fields. All methods and fields of
an interface must be public. 
</p>

<p>However, unlike a class, an interface can be added to a class
that is already a subclass of another class. Furthermore an
interface can apply to members of many different classes. For
instance you can define an <code>Import</code> interface with the
single method <code>calculateTariff()</code>.</p>



<pre xml:space="preserve"><code>public interface Import {

  public double calculateTariff();

}</code></pre>

<p>
You might want to use this interface on many different classes,
cars among them but also for clothes, food, electronics and moore.
It would be inconvenient to make all these objects derive from a
single class. Furthermore, each different type of item is likely to
have a different means of calculating the tariff. Therefore you
define an <code>Import</code> interface and declare that each class
implements <code>Import</code>. 
</p>

<p>The syntax is simple. <code>Import</code> is declared public so
that it can be accessed from any class. It is also possible to
declare that an interface is protected so that it can only be
implemented by classes in a particular package. However this is
very unusual. Almost all interfaces will be public. No interface
may be private because the whole purpose of an Interface is to be
inherited by other classes.</p>

<p>The <code>interface</code> keyword takes the place of the <code>
class</code> keyword. Line 3 looks like a classic method
definition. It's public (as it must be). It's abstract, also as it
must be. And it returns a <code>double</code>. The method's name is
<code>calculateTariff()</code> and it takes no arguments. The
difference between thisa and a method in a class is that there is
no method body. That remains to be created in each class that
implements the interface.</p>

<p>You can declare many different methods in an interface. These
methods may be overloaded. An interface can also have fields, but
if so they must be <code>final</code> and <code>static</code> (in
other words constants).</p>
