  <h1 align="center">Access Protection</h1>
<p>
Global variables are a classic cause of bugs in most programming
languages. Some unknown function can change the value of a variable
when the programmer isn't expecting it to change. This plays all
sorts of havoc.
</p>

<p>Most OOP languages including Java allow you to protect variables
from external modification. This allows you to guarantee that your
class remains consistent with what you think it is as long as the
methods of the class themselves are bug-free. For example, in the
<code>Car</code> class we'd like to make sure that no block of code in some
other class is allowed to make the speed greater than the maximum
speed. We want a way to make the following illegal:</p>



<pre xml:space="preserve"><code>  Car c = new Car("New York A234 567", 100.0);
  c.speed = 150.0;</code></pre>

<p>
This code violates the constraints we've placed on the class. We
want to allow the compiler to enforce these constraints. 
</p>

<p>

A class presents a picture of itself to the world. (This picture is
sometimes called an <dfn>interface</dfn>, but the word <i>
interface</i> has a more specific meaning in Java.) This picture
says that the class has certain methods and certain fields.
Everything else about the class including the detailed workings of
the class's methods is hidden. As long as the picture the class
shows to the world doesn't change, the programmer can change how
the class implements that picture. Among other advantages this
allows the programmer to change and improve the algorithms a class
uses without worrying that some piece of code depends in unforeseen
ways on the details of the algorithm used. This is called
encapsulation.</p>

<p>Another way to think about encapsulation is that a class signs a
contract with all the other classes in the program. This contract
says that a class has methods with unambiguous names which take
particular types of arguments and return a particular type of
value. The contract may also say that a class has fields with given
names and of a given type. However the contract does not specify
how the methods are implemented. Furthermore, it does not say that
there aren't other private fields and methods which the class may
use. A contract guarantees the presence of certain methods and
fields. It does not exclude all other methods and fields. This
contract is implemented through access protection. Every class,
field and method in a Java program is defined as either public,
private, protected or unspecified.</p>

<p>You're closer to your immediate family (your parents and your
children) than you are to your cousins. You're closer to your
cousins than to the general public at large, but there are some
things you don't tell anybody. Furthermore, your family is not my
family.</p>
