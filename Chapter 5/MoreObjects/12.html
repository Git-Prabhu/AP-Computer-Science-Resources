  <h1 align="center">Overriding Methods: The Solution</h1>
<p>
The object oriented solution to this problem is to define a new
class, call it <code>SlowCar</code>, which inherits from <code>
Car</code> and imposes the additional constraint that a car may not
go faster than 70 mph (112.65 kph). 
</p>

<p>To do this you'll need to adjust the two places that speed can
be changed, the constructor and the <code>accelerate()</code>
method. The constructor has a different name because all
constructors are named after their classes but the <code>
accelerate()</code> method must be <dfn>overridden</dfn>. This
means the subclass has a method with the same signature as the
method in the superclass.</p>



<pre xml:space="preserve"><code>public class SlowCar extends Car {

  private static final double speedLimit = 112.65408; // kph == 70 mph

  public SlowCar(String licensePlate, double speed, double maxSpeed,
   String make, String model, int year, int numberOfPassengers, int numDoors) {
    
    super(licensePlate, speed, maxSpeed, make, model, year, 
     numberOfPassengers, numDoors);
    if (speed &gt; speedLimit) this.speed = speedLimit;
    
  }

  public void accelerate(double deltaV) {

     double speed = this.getSpeed() + deltaV;
     
     if (speed &gt; speedLimit) {
       super.accelerate(speedLimit - this.getSpeed());
     }
     else {
       super.accelerate(deltaV);  
     }  
     
  }
   
}</code></pre>

<p>
The first thing to note about this class is what it doesn't have,
<code>getSpeed()</code>, <code>getLicensePlate()</code>, <code>
getMaximumSpeed()</code>, <code>setLicensePlate()</code> methods or
<code>speed</code>, <code>maxSpeed</code> and <code>numDoors</code>
fields. All of these are provided by the superclass <code>
Car</code>. Nothing about them has changed so they don't need to be
repeated here. 
</p>

<p>Next look at the <code>accelerate()</code> method. This is
different than the <code>accelerate()</code> method in <code>
Car</code>. It imposes the additional constraint. Since the <code>
speed</code> and <code>maxSpeed</code> fields from <code>Car</code>
are protected, they're accessible from this subclass.</p>

<p>The constructor is a little more complicated. First note that if
you're going to use a non-default constructor, that is a
constructor with arguments, you do need to write a constructor for
the subclass, even if it's just going to do the exact same thing as
the matching constructor in the superclass. You cannot simply
inherit <code>Car</code>'s constructor because that constructor is
named <code>Car()</code> and this one must be named <code>
SlowCar()</code>.</p>

<p>The constructor needs to set the value of name, url, and
description. However they're not accessible from the subclass.
Instead they are set by calling the superclass's constructor using
the keyword <code>super</code>. When <code>super</code> is used as
a method in the first non-blank line of a constructor, it stands
for the constructor of this class's superclass.</p>

<p>The immediate superclass's constructor <em>will</em> be called
in the first non-blank line of the subclass's constructor. If you
don't call it explicitly, then Java will call it for you with no
arguments. It's a compile time error if the immediate superclass
doesn't have a constructor with no arguments and you don't call a
different constructor in the first line of the subclass's
constructor.</p>

<p>The use of the ternary operator in the constructor call is
unusual. However, it's necessary to meet the compiler's requirement
that the invocation of <code>super</code> be the first line in the
subclass constructor. Otherwise this could be written more clearly
using only <code>if</code>-<code>else</code>.</p>
