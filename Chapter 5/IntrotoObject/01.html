  <h1 align="center">What is Object Oriented Programming?</h1>
<p>
In classic, procedural programming you try to make the real world
problem you're attempting to solve fit a few, pre-determined data
types: integers, floats, Strings, and arrays perhaps. In object
oriented programming you create a model for a real world system.
Classes are programmer-defined types that model the parts of the
system.
</p>

<p>A <dfn>class</dfn> is a programmer defined type that serves as a
blueprint for instances of the class. You can still have ints,
floats, Strings, and arrays; but you can also have cars,
motorcycles, people, buildings, clouds, dogs, angles, students,
courses, bank accounts, and any other type that's important to your
problem.</p>

<p>Classes specify the data and behavior possessed both by
themselves and by the objects built from them. A class has two
parts: the fields and the methods. Fields describe what the class
is. Methods describe what the class does.</p>

<p>Using the blueprint provided by a class, you can create any
number of objects, each of which is called an <dfn>instance</dfn>
of the class. Different objects of the same class have the same
fields and methods, but the values of the fields will in general
differ. For example, all humans have eye color but the color of
each human's eyes can be different from others.</p>

<p>On the other hand, objects have the same methods as all other
objects in the class except in so far as the methods depend on the
value of the fields and arguments to the method.</p>

<p>This dichotomy is reflected in the runtime form of objects.
Every object has a separate block of memory to store its fields,
but the bytes in the actual methods are shared between all objects
in a class.</p>

<p>Another common analogy is that a class is to an object as a
cookie cutter is to a cookie. One cookie cutter can make many
cookies. There may be only one class, but there can be many objects
in that class. Each object is an instance of one class.</p>
