  <h1 align="center">Overloading</h1>
<p>
Overloading is when the same method or operator can be used on many
different types of data. For instance the + sign is used to add
ints as well as concatenate strings. The plus sign behaves
differently depending on the type of its arguments. Therefore the
plus sign is inherently overloaded. 
</p>

<p>Methods can be overloaded as well. <code>
System.out.println()</code> can print a <code>double</code>, a
<code>float</code>, an <code>int</code>, a <code>long</code>, or a
<code>String</code>. You don't do anything different depending on
the type of number you want the value of. Overloading takes care of
it.</p>

<p>Programmer-defined classes can overload methods as well. To do
this simply write two methods with the same name but different
argument lists. For instance last week you saw several different
versions of the <code>Car</code> constructor, one that took three
arguments and one that took two arguments, and one that took no
arguments. You can use all of these in a single class, though here
I only use two because there really aren't any good default values
for <code>licensePlate</code> and <code>maxSpeed</code>. On the
other hand, 0 is a perfectly reasonable default value for <code>
speed</code>.</p>



<pre xml:space="preserve"><code>public class Car {

  private String licensePlate; // e.g. "New York A456 324"
  private double speed;        // kilometers per hour
  private double maxSpeed;     // kilometers per hour
  
  // constructors
  public Car(String licensePlate, double maxSpeed) {

    this.licensePlate = licensePlate; 
    this.speed  = 0.0;
    if (maxSpeed &gt;= 0.0) {
      this.maxSpeed = maxSpeed;
    }
    else {
      maxSpeed = 0.0;
    }
    
  }

  public Car(String licensePlate, double speed, double maxSpeed) {

    this.licensePlate = licensePlate; 
    if (maxSpeed &gt;= 0.0) {
      this.maxSpeed = maxSpeed;
    }
    else {
      maxSpeed = 0.0;
    }
    
    if (speed &lt; 0.0) {
      speed = 0.0;
    }
    
    if (speed &lt;= maxSpeed) {
      this.speed = speed;
    }
    else {
      this.speed = maxSpeed;
    }
    
  }

  // other methods...
  
}</code></pre>

<p>
Normally a single identifier refers to exactly one method or
constructor. When as above, one identifier refers to more than one
method or constructor, the method is said to be <dfn>
overloaded</dfn>. You could argue that this should be called
identifier overloading rather than method overloading since it's
the identifier that refers to more than one method, not the method
that refers to more than one identifier. However in common usage
this is called method overloading.
</p>

<p>Which method an identifier refers to depends on the signature.
The signature is the number, type, and order of the arguments
passed to a method. The signature of the first constructor in the
above program is <code>Car(String, double)</code>. The signature of
the second method is <code>Car(String, double, double)</code>. Thus
the first version of the <code>Car()</code> constructor is called
when there is one String argument followed by one double argument
and the second version is used when there is one String argument
followed by two double arguments.</p>



<p>
If there are no arguments to the constructor, or two or three
arguments that aren't the right type in the right order, then the
compiler generates an error because it doesn't have a method whose
signature matches the requested method call. For example
</p>
